# Requirements
<!-- 
An idea of what is required to make the project actually happen
-->

1. **People**: The lead developer will be responsible for developing the R package and coordinating with the RCWG.

2. **Processes**: The project will follow the best practices for R package development and will seek feedback from the R community to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users.

3. **Tools & Tech**: The project will use several packages in R that support the package development process (devtools, testthat, roxygen2, pkgdown), GitHub, and the Weblate API. 

4. **Funding**: The project requires funding to support the development of the R package. The funding will be used to cover the costs associated with the development, testing, documentation, and release of the package by the lead developer.

The project will require coordination between the lead developer, the RCWG, and the R community to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users and is easy to use.

## People
<!--
Who needs to be involved, what's the proposed structure, what will it take to get their involvement?
-->

Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal, who is a Research Software Engineer at Imperial College London, will be the lead developer for this project. She has experience in developing R packages and has contributed to the R community. She will be responsible for developing the R package and coordinating with the RCWG to ensure that the glossary is consistent across languages. Saranjeet is a member of the RCWG, where she has co-authored the [R Development Guide](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/) and has also contributed to translations of R message to Hindi.

The RCWG will be involved in this project to provide guidance and support. The RCWG is a group of volunteers who are actively involved in improving the R ecosystem and have experience in translation projects.

Feedback on the work will be sought from the R community at large, especially from users who are involved in the translations process. This will help in ensuring that the package meets the needs of the community and is easy to use.

## Processes
<!-- 
What processes need to be put in place e.g. codes of conduct, regular ISC meetings, handover to the community at large?
-->

The project will follow the following processes:

1. **Development**: The R package will be developed using the R package development tools (`devtools`, `testthat`, `roxygen2`). It will be hosted on GitHub and will follow the best practices for R package development.

2. **Translation**: Feedback will be sought from the R community to ensure that the glossary is consistent across languages.

3. **Community engagement**: Regular updates will be provided to the R community on the progress of the project through the RCWG meetings and occasionally through the R Contributor Office Hours. Feedback will be sought from the community to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users.

4. **Handover and maintenance**: Eventually, the will be maintained by the RCWG.

5. **Code of conduct**: A code of conduct will be put in place to ensure that the project is a safe and welcoming space for all contributors.


## Tools & Tech
<!--
What is going to be needed to deliver this project? 

Will cloud computing be used - if yes are there are necessary components that will be deciding factors between providers?

Are there tools or tech that don't exist that will be produced to facilitate the project?
-->

The project will use several packages in R that support the package development process (devtools, testthat, roxygen2, pkgdown), GitHub, and the Weblate API. Most of these tools are open-source and widely used in the R community. The Weblate API is used by the RCWG to track and translate messages in R.

## Funding
<!-- 
[TO DO] THE GUIDANCE IS PRETTY UNCLEAR, ESP IN LIGHT OF GABOR'S PROPOSAL VS AWARD SIZE

-->

The project seeks funding from the R Consortium Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) to support the development of the R package. The funding will be used to cover the time that the lead developer will invest in the development of the package.

The total funding requested for the project is $5,000.

## Summary
<!--
A summary of the requirements that contextualises the costs
-->

The project requires funding to support the development of a data package in R and streamlining the translation process for the R community. The lead developer will be responsible for developing the R package and coordinating with the RCWG to ensure that the glossary is consistent across languages. The project will follow best practices for R package development and will seek feedback from the R community to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users. Thus improving the translations infrastructure in R and making it easier for users to contribute to the translations process. The funding will be used to cover the time that the lead developer will invest in the development of the package.
