# Requirements
<!-- 
An idea of what is required to make the project actually happen
-->

The project requires the following to make it happen:

1. **People**: The project requires a lead developer who has experience in developing R packages and has contributed to the R community. The lead developer will be responsible for developing the R package and coordinating with the RCWG.

2. **Processes**: The project will follow the best practices for R package development and will seek feedback from the R community to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users.

3. **Tools & Tech**: The project will use R, devtools, testthat, roxygen2, pkgdown, GitHub, and the Weblate API to develop the package. The package will eventually be released on CRAN so that it is easily accessible to users.

4. **Funding**: The project requires funding to support the development of the R package. The funding will be used to cover the costs associated with the development, testing, documentation, and release of the package by the lead developer.

The project will require coordination between the lead developer, the RCWG, and the R community to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users and is easy to use.

## People
<!--
Who needs to be involved, what's the proposed structure, what will it take to get their involvement?
-->

Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal, who is a Research Software Engineer at Imperial College London, will be the lead developer for this project. She has experience in developing R packages and has contributed to the R community. She will be responsible for developing the R package and coordinating with the RCWG to ensure that the glossary is consistent across languages. Saranjeet is a member of the RCWG, where she has co-authored the [R Development Guide](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/) and has also contributed to translations of R message to Hindi.

The RCWG will be involved in this project to provide guidance and support. The RCWG is a group of volunteers who are actively involved in improving the R ecosystem and have experience in translation projects.

Feedback on the work will be sought from the R community at large, especially from users who are involved in the translations process. This will help in ensuring that the package meets the needs of the community and is easy to use.

## Processes
<!-- 
What processes need to be put in place e.g. codes of conduct, regular ISC meetings, handover to the community at large?
-->

The project will follow the following processes:

1. **Development**: The R package will be developed using the `devtools` package. The package will be hosted on GitHub and will follow the best practices for R package development.

2. **Testing**: The package will be tested using the `testthat` package. Unit tests will be written to ensure that the package functions as expected.

3. **Documentation**: The package will be documented using `roxygen2` and `pkgdown`. The documentation will be available on the package website.

4. **Translation**: Feedback will be sought from the R community to ensure that the glossary is consistent across languages.

5. **Release**: The plan is to eventually release the package on CRAN so that it is easily accessible to users.

6. **Community engagement**: Regular updates will be provided to the R community on the progress of the project through the [R Contributor Office Hours](https://contributor.r-project.org/events/office-hours/). Feedback will be sought from the community to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users.

7. **Handover**: The package will be handed over to the R community at large so that they can contribute to its development and maintenance.

8. **Code of conduct**: A code of conduct will be put in place to ensure that the project is a safe and welcoming space for all contributors.

9. **Governance**: The project will be governed by the RCWG to ensure that it aligns with the goals of the R community.

10. **Sustainability**: The project will be designed to be sustainable in the long term.

11. **Feedback**: Feedback will be sought from the R community to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users.

## Tools & Tech
<!--
What is going to be needed to deliver this project? 

Will cloud computing be used - if yes are there are necessary components that will be deciding factors between providers?

Are there tools or tech that don't exist that will be produced to facilitate the project?
-->

The project will use the following tools and technologies:

1. **R**: The project will be developed using the R programming language.

2. **devtools**: The package will be developed using the `devtools` package.

3. **testthat**: The package will be tested using the `testthat` package.

4. **roxygen2**: The package will be documented using the `roxygen2` package.

5. **pkgdown**: The documentation will be available on the package website.

6. **GitHub**: The package will be hosted on GitHub.

7. **Weblate API**: The package will use the Weblate API.

8. **CRAN**: The plan is to eventually release the package on CRAN.

Most of the tools stated above are open-source and widely used in the R community. The Weblate API is used by the RCWG to track and translate messages in R.

## Funding
<!-- 
[TO DO] THE GUIDANCE IS PRETTY UNCLEAR, ESP IN LIGHT OF GABOR'S PROPOSAL VS AWARD SIZE

-->

The project seeks funding from the R Consortium Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) to support the development of the R package. The funding will be used to cover the costs associated with the development, testing, documentation, and release of the package by the lead developer.

The total funding expected for the project is $8,000. The breakdown of the costs is as follows:


## Summary
<!--
A summary of the requirements that contextualises the costs
-->

The project requires funding to support the development of a data package in R and streamlining the translation process for the R community. The lead developer will be responsible for developing the R package and coordinating with the RCWG to ensure that the glossary is consistent across languages. The project will follow best practices for R package development and will seek feedback from the R community to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users. Thus improving the translations infrastructure in R and making it easier for users to contribute to the translations process. The funding will be used to cover the costs associated with the development, testing, documentation, and release of the package by the lead developer.
