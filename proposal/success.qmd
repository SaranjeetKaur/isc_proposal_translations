# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

The project will be considered a success if the following criteria are met:

1. The R package is developed and tested.

2. The package is documented and available on the package website.

3. Eventually release the package on CRAN. (This may not happen within the proposed timeline but is a long-term goal. However, the package will be available on GitHub for users to access.)

4. Feedback will be sought from the R community to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users.

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->

The project will be considered done when the following criteria are met:

1. The R package is developed and tested.

2. The package is documented and available on the package website.

3. Feedback will be sought from the R community to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users.

4. Long-term goal: The package is released on CRAN.

## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->

The success of the project will be measured by the following metrics:

1. Closing the issues related to the package development on GitHub.

2. Pull requests are reviewed and merged.

3. The package is documented and available on the package website.

## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

The project can be extended in the following ways:

1. Add more functions to the package to make it more user-friendly.

2. Improve the translation process by adding more languages to the glossary.

3. Add more features to the package to make it more useful for users.

4. Improve the documentation and make it more accessible to users.

5. Release the package on CRAN to make it more accessible to users.

The are not any major risks associated with this project. The idea for the project is based on an actual need by the R community and has the support of the RCWG. The lead developer has experience in developing R packages and has contributed to the R community. The project will follow the best practices for R package development and will seek feedback from the R community to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users.
