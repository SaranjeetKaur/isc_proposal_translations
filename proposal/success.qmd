# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

The project will be considered a success if the following criteria are met:


- The key deliverables are met: the package includes the planned functionality, which is documented and tested.
- The documentation is available on the package website.
- At least 75% of the open issues on the planned work are closed or at least become work-in-progress.
- Feedback is sought (and incorporated as far as possible) from the R community.
- At least two community members that are not directly involved in the project contribute to the project, by submitting issues, making a pull request or making a commit to the git repository.

## Definition of done
<!--

- Feedback will be sought from the R community to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users.

## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->

The success of the project will be measured by the following metrics:
