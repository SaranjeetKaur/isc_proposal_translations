# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

The project will be considered a success if the following criteria are met:


- The key deliverables are met: the package includes the planned functionality, which is documented and tested.
- The documentation is available on the package website.
- At least 75% of the open issues on the planned R package repository are closed or at least become work-in-progress.
- Eventually release the package on CRAN. (This may not happen within the proposed timeline but is a long-term goal. However, the package will be available on GitHub for users to access.)
- Feedback is sought (and incorporated as far as possible) from the R community to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users.
- At least two community members that are not directly involved in the project contribute to the package development, by submitting issues, making a pull request or making a commit to the git repository.

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->

The project will be considered done when the following criteria are met:

- The R package is developed and tested.

- The package is documented and available on the package website.

- Feedback will be sought from the R community to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users.

- Long-term goal: The package is released on CRAN.

## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->

The success of the project will be measured by the following metrics:

- At least 75% of the open issues on the planned R package repository are closed or at least become work-in-progress.

- At least 85% of the pull requests are reviewed and merged.

- The package is documented and available on the package website.

## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

The project can be extended in the following ways:

1. Add more functions to the package to make it more user-friendly.

2. Improve the translation process by adding more languages to the glossary.

3. Add more features to the package to make it more useful for users.

4. Improve the documentation and make it more accessible to users.

5. Release the package on CRAN to make it more accessible to users.

## Key risks

The are not any major risks associated with this project. The idea for the project is based on an actual need by the R community and has the support of the RCWG. The lead developer has experience in developing R packages and has contributed to the R community. The project will follow the best practices for R package development and will seek feedback from the R community to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users.
