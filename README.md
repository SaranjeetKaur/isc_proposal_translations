[![build-status](https://github.com/SaranjeetKaur/isc_proposal_translations/actions/workflows/publish-proposal.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SaranjeetKaur/isc_proposal_translations/actions/workflows/publish-proposal.yaml)

This repository contains the proposal for "Consistent Translations Glossary across R". The proposal aims to improve the technical infrastructure of the translations process for R packages. The goal is to provide a common shared glossary across the different R translations projects. It will help in improving the quality of translations and make it easier for users to contribute to the translations process. This will help in making R more accessible to users who do not speak English and improve the overall user experience of R. Feedback on the proposal is welcome - please feel free to provide your feedback by opening an issue in this repository.
